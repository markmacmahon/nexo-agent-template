# Nexo Agent Template

**An orchestration layer for modular conversational agents.**

Build AI agents that share state, compose seamlessly, and integrate anywhere - chatbots, workflows, or standalone apps. Agents connect via webhooks and receive shared context (user preferences, conversation memory) at runtime.

## Vision

Most conversational systems tightly couple state with execution. This runtime **decouples** them:

- **Shared state layer** - User preferences, memory, and context managed centrally
- **Agent orchestration** - Route between multiple agents while preserving context
- **Modular composition** - Add agents without changing infrastructure
- **Flexible deployment** - Standalone service or embedded in existing systems

**Today:** Foundation runtime with webhook routing, SSE streaming, and conversation threading.
**Tomorrow:** Stateful orchestration with centralized state store, runtime context injection, and agent-to-agent handoff.

## Overview

The **Dashboard** is where you create, configure, test, and monitor your agents. Each agent connects via webhook, receiving customer messages and returning responses - either simple answers or multi-turn flows. A built-in simulator lets you test integrations without deploying a backend.

### Current Capabilities

- **Dashboard** for creating and managing agents, viewing subscribers, and monitoring conversations
- **Webhook integration** with HMAC-SHA256 signing, SSE streaming, and in-app contract documentation
- **Built-in simulator** for testing conversational flows without an external backend
- **Real-time chat** with SSE token streaming, threaded conversations, and subscriber tracking
- **End-to-end type safety** with auto-generated OpenAPI clients
- **User authentication** via fastapi-users with JWT and password recovery
- **PostgreSQL database** with async SQLAlchemy and Alembic migrations
- **Modern UI** built with shadcn/ui and Tailwind CSS

## Technology Stack

- **Zod + TypeScript** – Type safety and schema validation across the stack
- **fastapi-users** – Complete authentication system with secure password hashing, JWT authentication, and email-based password recovery
- **shadcn/ui** – Prebuilt React components with Tailwind CSS
- **OpenAPI-fetch** – Fully typed client generation from the OpenAPI schema
- **UV** – Python dependency management and packaging
- **Docker Compose** – Consistent environments for development and production
- **Pre-commit hooks** – Automated code linting, formatting, and validation before commits

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.12
- Node.js and npm
- pnpm (`npm install -g pnpm`)
- uv (Python dependency manager)
- Docker and Docker Compose

## Getting Started

### 1. Environment Setup

```bash
# Backend environment
cd backend
cp .env.example .env

# Generate secret keys (run three times, one for each key in .env)
python3 -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"

# Frontend environment
cd frontend
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Edit `backend/.env` and add your generated secret keys for:
- `ACCESS_SECRET_KEY`
- `RESET_PASSWORD_SECRET_KEY`
- `VERIFICATION_SECRET_KEY`

### 2. Database Setup

```bash
# Build and start database container
docker compose build db
docker compose up -d db

# Apply database migrations
make docker-migrate-db
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

**Without Docker:**
```bash
# Backend
cd backend
uv sync

# Frontend
cd frontend
pnpm install
```

**With Docker:**
```bash
make docker-build
```

### 4. Run the Application

**Without Docker:**
```bash
# Start backend (from project root)
make start-backend

# Start frontend (from project root, in another terminal)
make start-frontend
```

**With Docker:**
```bash
# Start backend container
make docker-start-backend

# Start frontend container
make docker-start-frontend
```

### 5. Access the Application

- **Frontend:** http://localhost:3000
- **Backend API:** http://localhost:8000
- **API Documentation:** http://localhost:8000/docs

### 6. Webhook examples (optional)

The **[examples/](examples/)** directory contains minimal webhook servers (Python stdlib, Node.js) that implement the partner webhook contract. Use them to test the platform with a real webhook or as a reference for your own integration.

- **Run an example:** See [examples/README.md](examples/README.md) for step-by-step instructions (start one example, set its URL in an App, then chat).
- **Verify they work:** From the project root run `make test-examples`. This starts each example in turn, sends a test request, and checks the response (requires Python 3 and Node.js).

Ports: Python 8080, TypeScript 8081 (overridable with `PORT`). They do not conflict with the main app (3000, 8000).

## GitHub Actions (CI)

The CI workflow runs backend and frontend tests with **sensible defaults**; no repository secrets are required for CI.

- **Backend:** Uses the default test database URL. The workflow starts a Postgres service and sets `TEST_DATABASE_URL` so tests run against it.
- **Frontend:** Uses default build and test settings; no environment variables are set in CI.

If you add workflows that deploy (e.g. to Vercel or a Python host), configure the environment variables described in [Deployment](#deployment) as GitHub Secrets or in your deployment platform.

## Environment variables for deployment

**Most environment variables have sensible defaults and work out of the box for local development.** You only need to configure these when deploying to production.

### Next.js frontend

Set these in your Next.js project (Vercel: Project → Settings → Environment Variables):

| Variable | Required | Description | Default (local) |
|----------|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` | Yes (production) | Backend API URL used by the browser (e.g. chat stream). | `http://localhost:8000` |
| `API_BASE_URL` | Yes (production) | Backend API URL used by the Next.js server (API client). | `http://localhost:8000` |

In production, set both to your backend URL (e.g. `https://api.yourdomain.com`). For local dev, the app falls back to `http://localhost:8000` where applicable.

### Python backend

Set these on the process that runs the FastAPI app:

| Variable | Required | Description | Default (local) |
|----------|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| `DATABASE_URL` | Yes (production) | PostgreSQL connection string. | `postgresql+asyncpg://postgres:password@localhost:5432/nexo_db` |
| `DATABASE_POOL_CLASS` | No | Connection pooling: `"null"` (serverless) or `"queue"` (traditional servers). | `"null"` |
| `ACCESS_SECRET_KEY` | Yes (production) | JWT access token secret (min 32 chars). | Dev default; **must** override in production. |
| `RESET_PASSWORD_SECRET_KEY` | Yes (production) | Password reset token secret. | Dev default; **must** override in production. |
| `VERIFICATION_SECRET_KEY` | Yes (production) | Email verification token secret. | Dev default; **must** override in production. |
| `CORS_ORIGINS` | Yes (production) | Allowed origins (set format depends on host). | `http://localhost:3000`, `http://localhost:8000` |
| `FRONTEND_URL` | Recommended | Frontend base URL (e.g. for password reset links). | `http://localhost:3000` |

Generate secure secret keys (run three times for the three keys):

```bash
python3 -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"
```

**Connection Pooling**: Set `DATABASE_POOL_CLASS=queue` for better performance on traditional servers (Docker, VPS). Defaults to `"null"` for serverless compatibility.

Optional for production: `MAIL_*` (SMTP), `OPENAPI_OUTPUT_FILE`, `OPENAPI_URL`, webhook header names, `DATABASE_POOL_SIZE`, `DATABASE_MAX_OVERFLOW`, `DATABASE_POOL_RECYCLE`. See `backend/.env.example` and `backend/app/config.py` for all options.

## Development Tips

### Environment Setup

- **Use either Docker or local setup consistently** - don't mix them for the same project session
- The database is configured as `nexo_db` for development and runs on port 5432
- Frontend runs on port 3000, backend on port 8000 - these ports are configured in docker-compose.yml

### Keep Your Mac Awake During Development

Prevent your Mac from sleeping during long-running development tasks:

```bash
# Keep display awake for 2 hours (7200 seconds)
caffeinate -d -u -t 7200
```

### Pre-commit Hooks

Before committing, run:

```bash
make precommit
```

This runs linting, formatting, and type checking. Dependencies install automatically if needed.

### Clean Development Environment

To ensure a clean development environment:

1. **Stop unnecessary Docker containers**:
   ```bash
   docker ps  # See what's running
   docker stop <container-name>  # Stop unneeded containers
   ```

2. **Use PostgreSQL in Docker** (recommended):
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d db  # Start only the database
   ```

3. **Clear frontend cache** if you encounter build issues:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   rm -rf .next node_modules/.cache
   pnpm run dev
   ```

4. **Check for port conflicts** - ensure these ports are free:
   - 3000 (Frontend)
   - 8000 (Backend)
   - 5432 (PostgreSQL main)
   - 5433 (PostgreSQL test)

### Type Safety & API Sync

- API documentation is auto-generated at http://localhost:8000/docs
- **OpenAPI schema and TypeScript types sync automatically** when using `make` commands
- Watchers monitor backend routes and auto-regenerate frontend types

**How it works:**
1. Backend watcher detects changes to routes/schemas
2. Auto-generates `local-shared-data/openapi.json`
3. Frontend watcher detects JSON change
4. Auto-regenerates TypeScript types in `lib/openapi-client/`

Manual regeneration (if needed): `cd frontend && pnpm run generate-client`

### Testing

Run tests for both backend and frontend:

```bash
# Backend tests
make test-backend

# Frontend tests
make test-frontend

# With Docker
make docker-test-backend
make docker-test-frontend
```

### Database Migrations

Create and apply database schema changes with Alembic:

```bash
# Create a new migration
make docker-db-schema migration_name="add users table"

# Apply migrations
make docker-migrate-db
```

### Email Testing (MailHog)

For local email testing, start the MailHog server:

```bash
make docker-up-mailhog
```

Access the email inbox at http://localhost:8025

## Deployment

- **Frontend (Next.js):** Deploy to Vercel or any Node.js host. Set [Next.js environment variables](#nextjs-frontend) (e.g. `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` and `API_BASE_URL`) to your backend URL.
- **Backend (FastAPI):** Deploy using Docker, Vercel, or any Python app server. Set [Python backend environment variables](#python-backend) (database URL, secret keys, CORS, frontend URL). Database is hosted separately.

## Chat Interface

The dashboard includes a real-time chat UI for testing and monitoring conversations:

- **SSE Streaming**: Token-by-token message display via Server-Sent Events
- **Threaded conversations**: Each customer interaction is a separate thread
- **Auto-resize Input**: Modern message input (44px-200px height)
- **Collapsible Sidebar**: Thread management with slide animations
- **Smart Scrolling**: Auto-scroll with manual override button
- **Mobile Responsive**: Overlay sidebar on mobile devices
- **Scenario demos**: Built-in presets (support triage, match commentary, reservations, surveys) stream canned user + assistant messages so stakeholders can experience long-running tasks without typing.

### Testing Your App

1. Create an App in the dashboard
2. Configure integration mode - use the simulator for testing or set up your webhook
3. Click "Chat" to open the chat interface and test the conversation flow

### Subscribers (conversations by customer)

From the apps table or the app page, use **Subscribers** to view conversations grouped by customer. The page uses a 3-panel layout (subscribers → threads → chat) with cursor-based pagination (`limit` + `cursor` query params, response `{ items, next_cursor }`). API: `GET /apps/{app_id}/subscribers`, `GET /apps/{app_id}/subscribers/{subscriber_id}/threads` (see OpenAPI at `/docs`).

## Documentation

- **[docs/](docs/)** - Project docs. Index: [docs/README.md](docs/README.md). Main reference: [docs/system-overview.md](docs/system-overview.md).
- **[examples/](examples/)** - Webhook examples (Python stdlib, Node http). Run in separate processes; ports 8080 (Python) and 8081 (Node). See [examples/README.md](examples/README.md). Run `make test-examples` to verify they start and respond correctly.
- **AI assistants and contributors:** [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) first (workflow, conventions), then docs/system-overview.md (architecture, API).

## Next Steps

1. Create an App and test with the built-in simulator
2. Build your webhook endpoint - see the in-app contract documentation for request/response format
3. Configure webhook URL and optional HMAC signing in your App settings
4. Use the Subscribers view to monitor customer conversations
5. Configure environment variables for production deployment
